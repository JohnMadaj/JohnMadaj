### Hi there, I'm John Madaj ðŸ‘‹ 

  This is my personal GitHub, which serves primarily as a repository for pet projects and projects I worked on during my undergraduate career. I am currently a software engineer in warehouse automation technology, and I work primarily in Java EE/EJB, with supporting experience in SQL, DB management, application server technology and industry web development.

  Some of my predominant projects in this hub include my engineering capstone application for Concussion Diagnostics, as well as my NLP ML research for the BioCreative competition.
